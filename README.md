ecoScan4x is a simple Python security header scanner that checks if a website has important HTTP security headers and highlights missing headers and associated risk levels.
The tool scans the target websiteâ€™s HTTP response headers and tells you:

Which security headers are present and properly configured

Which important security headers are missing
